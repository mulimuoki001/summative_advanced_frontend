Welcome to the final summative project of the Advanced Front-End module. This group project challenges you to showcase your advanced front-end development skills by building a dynamic and user-friendly dashboard for a university residence management system.

## Project Description

Develop a responsive and interactive dashboard for university residence staff using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a chosen framework (Bootstrap or Tailwind). The dashboard should provide the following functionalities:

### Functionalities

1. **Data Visualization**
   - Utilize charts and graphs (e.g., bar charts, pie charts) to represent residence data such as occupancy rates, room types, and maintenance requests.

2. **Room Management**
   - Display a list of rooms with details including resident information, room status (occupied, vacant, under maintenance), and basic amenities.
   - Include functionalities for filtering and sorting rooms.

3. **Maintenance Requests**
   - Provide a section to view and manage maintenance requests submitted by residents.
   - Include functionalities to filter by room, status (pending, ongoing, completed), and add notes.

4. **Alerts and Notifications**
   - Display important alerts and notifications for staff, such as upcoming room inspections, maintenance deadlines, or urgent resident requests.

5. **Theme Switcher**
   - Implement a feature that allows staff to switch between different themes (light/dark or custom colours) using browser storage (cookies or local storage).

## Technical Considerations

HTML5: 
The backbone of the application's structure provides the basic layout and elements.

CSS3:
Used for styling the application, ensuring a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.

Tailwind CSS:
A utility-first CSS framework that enables rapid UI development with a set of predefined classes. This was instrumental in maintaining consistency across the design and speeding up the development process.

JavaScript: 
Powers the interactive elements of the dashboard, handling user interactions and dynamic content updates.

Dart.js:
A JavaScript library is used for creating dynamic and interactive graphs, which are crucial for visualizing data related to residence occupancy, student feedback, and other key metrics.

This dashboard can be run and accessed via any browser. The following are the steps to be followed if you are to run the dashboard successfully.

1. Clone the git repo using your preferred code editor. I used Visual Studio Code.
   
               git clone https://github.com/mulimuoki001/summative_advanced_frontend.git

2. Run the dashboard code. There are many ways of running the code. I will use the Live Server to run the code.
   By all standards there are no special dependencies require for you to run the code efficiently.

This will be the landing page that you should see after successfully running the code.
